title: Outliers from our Archives
contributors: Kartik Agaram

We have a ton of great stuff in our archives. A wiki is a good place to surface the gems. I don't know what that should look like, but here's a very rudimentary early attempt.

There's often overlap between these lists, and I only list a thread in one list in these situations. (But I include stats where they could show up in multiple lists)

Some of these (particularly early) threads are chopped up across multiple threads when someone posted up top rather than in a comment. Feels like the sort of thing we could clean up in a wiki.
